# Statistics Calculator (Multi-Paradigm)

This project implements a basic statistics calculator that computes the mean, median, and mode of a list of integers.  
The goal is to demonstrate different programming paradigms using three languages.

## Languages and Paradigms
- C — Procedural
- OCaml — Functional
- Python — Object-Oriented

## Folder Structure

c/ -> C implementation
ocaml/ -> OCaml implementation
python/ -> Python implementation


## How to Run

### C
gcc statistics.c -o statistics
./statistics


### OCaml
ocamlc statistics.ml -o statistics
./statistics


### Python
python3 statistics.py


## Sample Input
[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8]

## Output
Displays mean, median, and mode in the terminal.
